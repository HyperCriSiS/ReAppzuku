### Phase 9 legacy-policy activation

Main before the current editor block: `fce4efef9e8a9d50be473234e6aa4ab7428534e9`

- Activated retry-safe legacy-to-`AppPolicy` reconciliation on normal process startup.
- Room schema 13 records policy provenance so explicit rows are never replaced by migration-owned rows.
- Migration-owned rows are bound to a deterministic legacy-state fingerprint; stale snapshots immediately fall back to the bounded live legacy resolver until the next successful reconciliation.
- A valid snapshot disables direct legacy fallback for packages without a policy, preserving unmanaged behavior for newly installed apps until the setup-queue work lands.
- Auto-Kill and Smart Lifecycle remain mutually exclusive through `AppPolicyResolver`.

Validation on main before this block included green CodeQL and Android 17 / API 37 runtime coverage.

### Phase 9 per-app Policy Editor

Merged PR: #64  
Merge commit: `56797a6c0d66b8d127c08da2fbee3d3afd524fa7`

- Added a per-app lifecycle Policy Editor reachable from the main app options sheet.
- Editor covers canonical strategy, reusable preset, Smart standby/force-stop delays, Immediate kill method, boot cleanup, background restriction, media/foreground-service/widget protections, and all six trigger bits.
- Saving writes an explicit `AppPolicy`, so user edits override migration-owned legacy materialization without changing Room schema 13.
- Built-in presets use stable IDs with localized display names; user-created presets are supported with `Save as preset`.
- Existing customized preset-backed policies are preserved during spinner initialization instead of being overwritten by the selected preset.
- Policy normalization rejects unknown strategy/restriction/kill values, strips unknown trigger bits, preserves Smart “never force-stop”, and clamps Smart force-stop delay so it cannot precede standby.
- Added focused JVM regressions for preset application, normalization, never-force-stop semantics and preset round trips.
- Added Policy Editor localization for Spanish, Russian, Ukrainian and Simplified Chinese.
- Existing app-option checkbox behavior/tint is intentionally unchanged; an incidental draft change was detected in diff review and reverted before merge.

### Phase 9 Automation Schedules separation

Merged PR: #65  
Merge commit: `f37505e6035b67a30170a625e51d2994a8b75e32`

- Renamed the two user-facing time-window Auto-Kill preset surfaces to Automation Schedules.
- Added `AutomationScheduleManager` as the schedule-named UI/API facade over the legacy implementation.
- Kept historical persisted preference stores, alarm broadcast actions, backup prefix and serialized model fields unchanged so upgrades retain schedules and pending alarms.
- Kept Room-backed `PolicyPreset` semantically separate: it remains a reusable per-app behavior template and has no schedule start/end fields.
- Historical default names `Preset 1` / `Preset 2` render with localized Automation Schedule labels; new JSON exports use schedule terminology.
- Localized the renamed surface for English, Spanish, Russian, Ukrainian and Simplified Chinese.
- Added focused compatibility and source-authoritative separation regressions.
- No Room schema change and no automation execution rewrite.

## Current Phase 9 architecture state

- Canonical strategies are `UNMANAGED`, `PROTECTED`, `SMART`, `IMMEDIATE`; `Custom` remains presentation/provenance state, not an execution engine.
- Auto-Kill and Smart Lifecycle both use `AppPolicyResolver`; one package cannot be owned by both engines.
- Explicit Room-backed policy always wins over legacy migration/fallback.
- Retry-safe schema-13 migration is active and fingerprints remaining editable legacy state.
- Per-app policy editing and reusable user presets now exist without another Room version bump.
- Automation Schedules are explicitly separate from reusable per-app `PolicyPreset` templates; legacy schedule persistence identifiers remain compatibility-only.
- Legacy global settings remain transition controls/fallback and must not be removed until remaining Phase 9 parity work is complete.
- Background-restriction strength is stored canonically, while exact manual AppOps/bucket/whitelist legacy details still remain in their existing per-package preference keys pending backup/UI parity work.

## Next work unit

**Durable new-app setup queue / default policy behavior**

1. Add `PACKAGE_ADDED` handling that never performs a privileged mutation by default.
2. Persist a durable Needs-setup queue so installs are not lost across process death/reboot.
3. Support the three configured outcomes from the roadmap: `Ask after install`, `Apply default preset`, or `Leave unmanaged`.
4. For Ask, surface a notification/deep link into ReAppzuku instead of launching an Activity over the foreground app.
5. Validate package identifiers and eligibility before queueing/applying policy, and keep protected/system/persistent packages fail-safe.
6. Add focused JVM/source tests plus Android-facing receiver/notification coverage before moving to main-list Needs-setup badges/filters.

## Guardrails

- Never allow Smart and Immediate automation to own the same package simultaneously.
- Explicit Room-backed policy always has precedence over migration-owned or legacy fallback state.
- Newly installed apps default to no privileged mutation unless the user explicitly selects an automatic default preset.
- Protected/system/persistent packages continue to fail safe regardless of stored policy.
- Policy presets describe per-app behavior; Automation Schedules describe when automation is active. Do not merge those concepts.
- Keep legacy UI/settings until migration, execution and backup/restore parity are proven.
